# Linked Data Mining Challenge 2015

Linked Data Mining Challenge 2015 - KI2NA entry

In this paper, we describe our submission to the 2015 Linked Data Mining Challenge. The proposed task concerns the prediction of review of movies as "good" or "bad". These labels are as the ones assigned to movies by the Metacritic website based on critics reviews. Although,several sources provide data about movies on the Web in different formats including RDF, data from HTML pages had to be gathered to fulfil some of our features. We train a decision tree model using features from our final knowledge base and achieve an accuracy of 0.939.
